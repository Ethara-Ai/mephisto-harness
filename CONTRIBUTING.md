# Contributing to SForge

Thank you for your interest in contributing to SForge! This document covers the guidelines and workflow for contributing to the harness codebase.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Docker Engine 24+
- `pip` for local editable installs

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repo-url> && cd SForge

# Install locally for development
pip install -e .

# Fetch task definitions and verify the CLI
sforge fetch-tasks edgebench
sforge list
```

## Development Workflow

1. Create a feature branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes — keep commits focused and atomic.
3. Run the checks described below before opening a PR.
4. Open a pull request with a clear description of *what* and *why*.

## Code Style

The project follows standard Python conventions. No automated formatter is enforced yet, but please adhere to the existing style:

- **Type annotations** — use modern syntax (`str | None`, `dict[str, str]`). All modules should include `from __future__ import annotations`.
- **Dataclasses** — prefer `@dataclass` for structured data over plain dicts or tuples.
- **Naming** — `snake_case` for functions/variables, `PascalCase` for classes, `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants. Prefix private helpers with `_`.
- **Docstrings** — module-level docstrings are encouraged. Keep function/class docstrings short and only when the name is not self-explanatory.
- **Comments** — explain *why*, not *what*. Avoid obvious or redundant comments.

## License Headers

All `.py` source files must include the Apache 2.0 license header at the top:

```python

For files with a shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env python3`), the license header goes immediately after the shebang line.

## Running Tests

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

## Common Contribution Scenarios

### Adding a New Agent

1. Create `sforge/harness/agent/<agent_name>.py` — subclass `Agent` from `sforge.harness.agent.base`.
2. Register the agent in `sforge/harness/agent/factory.py`.
3. Define `install_cmds` (how to install the agent CLI in a container) and implement the `run()` method.

### Adding a New Task

1. Create `tasks/<task_id>.json` with `work` and `judge` sections.
2. Work `setup_cmds` must delete test files and run `git init`; Judge keeps the full test suite.
3. If the language requires a new base image, add it to `BASE_IMAGE_REGISTRY` in `constants.py`.
4. If the test output format is new, add a parser (see below).

### Adding a Log Parser

1. Create `sforge/harness/log_parsers/<format>.py`.
2. Implement a `parse_<format>(log: str) -> list[TestResult]` function.
3. Register it in `sforge/harness/log_parsers/__init__.py`.
4. Reference the parser name in your task JSON's `judge.parser` field.

### Modifying the Judge Server API

The judge server (`sforge/harness/judge_server.py`) is a FastAPI app. When changing endpoints:

- Keep the `/api/v1/` prefix for all routes.
- Submissions are async — `POST /submit` enqueues, `GET /result/{id}` polls.
- Ensure backward compatibility or bump the API version.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused — one logical change per PR.
- Include a summary of what changed and why in the PR description.
- If your change affects task definitions or the judge API, describe how you tested it end-to-end (e.g., `sforge build` + `sforge serve` + `sforge run`).
- Do not commit files that contain secrets, API keys, or credentials.

## Reporting Issues

When filing a bug report, please include:

- The command you ran and its full output.
- Your Python version (`python --version`) and OS.
- Docker version (`docker --version`).
- The task ID and agent involved, if applicable.
